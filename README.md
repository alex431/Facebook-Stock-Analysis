# Facebook-Stock-Analysis

For the Code Louisville data analysis final project, I wanted to extend my work from the last cohort.This desire drove me to investigate Facebook.

In my data breaches analysis, I found that Facebook had experienced the most reported data breaches based on my dataset. In order to pursue this investigation into Facebook, I located and downloaded an dataset of their stock history found on Kaggle. I wanted to see if there were any effects from an financial perspective.

Upon investigation, I found some questions to ask against the dataset:
*What is the highest and lowest prices of stock?
*What is the the highest and lowest number of traded stocks?
*Is there relationship between the cost of stock and value of traded stocks?
*Does the effects of an breach become minimal depending on the organization's size?

Note: I started working on this project using anaconda which utilized python 3.9.13. After condsideration and failed update, I decided to try python 3.10.9.

Special Instructions: The pre-release version of Jupyter needs to be installed within Visual Studio Code.

* Wrote in Jupyter's markdown cells explaining my thought process and code.
